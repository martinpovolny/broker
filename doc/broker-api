JS directly consuming the API

creates uncrossable border between API implementation and the client (browser, js)

vs

thin controllers consuming the API
serving it in the form  best for the client

uncrossable border between API and the controller
more discipline


vs mixed together business and presentation logic (and storage)

like belief in god, good to deal with such people because they worship certain values (testimony), but does not make me a believer
