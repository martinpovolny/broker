Broker POC
==========

This project aims to implement a POC for a cloud broker as presented here: [1]
and [2].

The schema of the Broker is the variant 2 from [2].

POC consists of:

* deltacloud driver 'broker' that exposes the IaaS part of Broker functionality
* REST interface for the configuration part of Broker functionality

Instalation:
------------
The only database tested is postgresql. To populate the database schema run the
migrations in Rakefile.

To get the Broker running you need to have a version of deltacloud library that
allows the pseudo-library functionality using Faraday.

Then you need to link the dc-driver directory from the broker into
deltacloud-core like this:

ln -s path_to/broker/lib/dc-driver/ path_to/deltacloud-core-1.1.3/lib/deltacloud/drivers/

Next steps:
-----------
* make HEAT running on top of Deltacloud [3] run using the Broker driver.
